## Bio
Software Development Engineer at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
Elastic Container Services (ECS) Experiences Team

I build [AWS Copilot](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli) (AWS' opinionated, magical ECS deployment tool) and work on infrastructure as code integrations via the [AWS CDK extensions](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/@aws-cdk-containers/ecs-service-extensions). 

## Projects
### [DDOS](https://app.ddos.dog) (Daily Dose of Sweet)
Dog pictures as a service. Written in Go, deployed by AWS Copilot.

### [Wordpress on Copilot](https://github.com/bvtujo/copilot-wordpress)
Everything you need to run self-hosted, autoscaling Wordpress with serverless containers on ECS. 

## Blogs
### [Bread Diary](https://austinely.com/bread/)
Very small blog documenting some early sourdough experiments and, more recently, focaccia. 

### [The Anchovist](https://daniellelhenry01.wixsite.com/anchovist)
During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Danielle and I started a blog to keep track of our cooking.
